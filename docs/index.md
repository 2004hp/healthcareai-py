# Welcome to healthcare.ai!

The aim of **healthcareai** is to streamline machine learning in healthcare. The package has two main goals:

-  Allow one to easily create models based on tabular data, and deploy a best model that pushes predictions to SQL Server.
-  Provide tools related to data cleaning, manipulation, and imputation.

## Where's the source code?

Find our code at our [Github Repo ![Our Github repo](img/GitHub-Mark-120px-plus.png)](https://github.com/HealthCatalyst/healthcareai-py)

## Do I want this package or the [R package](http://healthcare.ai/r)?

Choose this Python package if one of the following apply:

- You're familiar with python
- You're familiar with machine learning
- You're working with 5M+ rows (which is rare)

Otherwise, the [R package](http://healthcare.ai/r) is recommended, as it
currently has more features and R is more newbie-friendly
