# Welcome to the healthcare.ai documentation!

The purpose of this python package is to streamline healthcare machine
learning. It does this by including functionality specific to
healthcare, as well as simplifying the workflow of creating and
deploying models.

## Do I want this package over the [R package](http://healthcare.ai/r)?

Choose this Python package if one of the following apply:

-   You're familiar with python
-   You're familiar with machine learning
-   You're working with 5M+ rows (which is rare)

Otherwise, the [R package](http://healthcare.ai/r) is recommended, as it
currently has more features and R is more newbie-friendly
